I'm Jamie Lord, Master of Computing (MComp) and winner of the prize for Outstanding Contribution from the University of Lincoln.

I love computers. Seriously, a lot. Because of this passion I pursued a Masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Lincoln which I completed in early 2016.

I frequently use .Net Core to create tools and systems to support my other work. Have a look at the [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) page for examples.

Since the first version, I've also been really interested in [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) and have been trying to find new use cases for the developing world of web assembly.
