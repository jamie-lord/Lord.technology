#### I'm Jamie Lord, Master of Computing (MComp) and winner of the prize for Outstanding Contribution from the University of Lincoln.

I love computers. Seriously, a lot. Because of this passion I've just completed my Masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Lincoln and making [lots of interesting digital things]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) to help expand my knowledge along the way.

As of November 2016 I work for IFS UK Research & Development as a Software Engineer.

Currently, I'm a Xamarin native developer working on a large and rather exciting new project targeting mobile platforms.
