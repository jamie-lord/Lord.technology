I'm Jamie Lord, a full stack developer currently building multi-tenant SaaS applications using Azure technologies and C#.

Experienced in building development teams and instilling a culture that results in reliable, maintainable products where team members feel empowered to increase quality and take real ownership of their work - I live and breath software development and relish the challenges it poses.

## My current work sees me using

- C# .Net 6.0
- GraphQL
- Entity Framework
- Postgres
- Angular
- Ionic
- Docker

It's pretty rare that I'm not toying with [a side-project or two](https://lord.technology/projects/) ([see GitHub for more](https://github.com/jamie-lord)) and I particularly enjoy using Blazor to rapidly prototype - something I've been doing since 0.1.0 back in March 2018.
