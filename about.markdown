I'm Jamie Lord, a full stack developer currently working as a Solution Architect building multi-tenant SaaS applications using Azure technologies and C#.

Experienced in building development teams and instilling a culture that results in reliable, maintainable products where team members feel empowered to increase quality and take real ownership of their work - I live and breath software development and relish the challenges it poses.

## My current work sees me using

*   C# .Net 10.0
    
*   Vue & Next.js
    
*   Azure
    
*   Cloudflare (lots of Cloudflare Developer Platform fun)
    
    *   Agents
        
    *   AI Gateway
        
    *   AI Search
        
    *   D1
        
    *   Durable Objects
        
    *   KV
        
    *   Queues
        
    *   R2
        
    *   Vectorize

    *   Workers AI
        
    *   Workflows
        
*   TypeScript
    

It's pretty rare that I'm not toying with [a side-project or two](https://lord.technology/projects/) ([see GitHub for more](https://github.com/jamie-lord)) and I particularly enjoy using Blazor to rapidly prototype - something I've been doing since 0.1.0 back in March 2018.
