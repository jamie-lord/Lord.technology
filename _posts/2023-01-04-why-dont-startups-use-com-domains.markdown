Startups can and do use .com domains, and many of them do. However, it is also common for startups to use other types of domains, such as .io, .co, .net, and others. There are a few reasons why startups might choose to use a domain other than .com:

1. .com domains may already be taken: With over 150 million .com domains registered, it can be difficult to find an available .com domain that is short, memorable, and relevant to your business. As a result, startups may need to look at other options.
2. .com domains can be expensive: Depending on the desired domain name, it can be expensive to purchase a .com domain. This may be especially true if the domain name is in high demand or if it is being sold by someone who is looking to profit from its sale.
3. Other domains can be more memorable or relevant: In some cases, startups may find that a domain other than .com is more memorable, easier to spell, or more relevant to their business. For example, a startup that provides tools for developers might choose a .io domain, as .io is often used by technology companies.

Overall, the choice of domain depends on the specific needs and goals of the startup, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
