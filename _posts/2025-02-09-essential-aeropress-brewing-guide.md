## Adjusting for Your Coffee

### Light Roasts

*   Use 11g coffee
    
*   Use boiling water (100°C)
    
*   Grind very fine
    
*   Best for floral/fruity notes
    

### Medium Roasts

*   Use 12-13g coffee
    
*   Water: 90-95°C
    
*   Grind medium-fine
    
*   Balanced flavour profile
    

### Dark Roasts

*   Use 13-14g coffee
    
*   Water: 85-90°C
    
*   Grind medium
    
*   Rich, bold flavours
    

## Troubleshooting

### Taste Problems

*   Too bitter → Grind coarser or reduce temperature
    
*   Too sour → Grind finer or increase temperature
    
*   Too weak → Increase dose or grind finer
    
*   Too strong → Reduce dose or add water after brewing
    

### Common Mistakes

*   Pressing too hard (gentle pressure is better)
    
*   Preheating (unnecessary)
    
*   Using inverted method (standard is better)
    
*   Rinsing filter (unnecessary)
    
*   Stirring (swirling is better)
    

## Advanced Techniques

### Brewing for Two

Concentrate Method:

*   22g coffee
    
*   Maximum water
    
*   Dilute after brewing

### Filter Options

*   Paper: Clean cup, can reuse 2-3 times immediately
    
*   Metal: More oils, French press style
    
*   Cloth: Balance of clarity and body
    

### Optimising by Style

For Floral/Bright Coffees:

*   Maximum temperature
    
*   Finer grind
    
*   Standard dose (11g)
    

For Full-Bodied:

*   Higher dose (13-14g)
    
*   Longer steep
    
*   Medium-fine grind
    

## Quick Reference

*   Standard ratio: 55g coffee per litre water
    
*   Optimal steep: 2 minutes
    
*   Press time: 30 seconds
    
*   No special kettle needed
    
*   Pressing through 'hiss' is fine
