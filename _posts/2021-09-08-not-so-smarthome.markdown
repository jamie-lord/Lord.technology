Having recently moved house, we've come to the conclusion that we don't need and won't be reinstalling our smart lightbulbs and Amazon Echos, or any other smart devices for that matter.

Our usage was light to begin with, mostly casting Spotify to the Echos and asking for the news. As the Echos don't fill our new kitchen and sitting room with sound very well we've decided to invest in a better sound system and scrap the smartcrap. Additionally, with the way the world continues to go, listening to the news whilst eating dinner isn't very pleasant any more (I'm not sure it ever was but at least there used to be *some* variation from day to day).

I love LED lightbulbs - the energy efficiency makes me very happy. The only feature we did use with smart lightbulbs though was the ability to turn them on when we weren't at home, but with the pandemic and remote working this has become unnecessary and I don't see this changing anytime soon. For this reason, normal LED bulbs are more than adequate.
