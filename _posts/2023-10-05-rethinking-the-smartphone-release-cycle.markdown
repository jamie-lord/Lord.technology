Yearly smartphone releases have become a ludicrous norm, with companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung barely justifying new models with marginal hardware improvements and software features that could often be rolled out to existing devices. This relentless cycle isn’t just about the thinly veiled cash grab from consumers; it's a sustainability nightmare, generating mountains of electronic waste and rendering perfectly usable accessories obsolete.

The environmental and economic implications of this practice are too significant to ignore. The production, distribution, and disposal of smartphones and their myriad of accessories contribute to resource depletion, carbon emissions, and a wasteful consumer culture. It's a perpetual, unsustainable loop of purchase and discard, driven by planned obsolescence and a constant barrage of marginally improved devices.

Planned obsolescence, where devices are intentionally designed to have a limited lifespan, often through software updates that degrade performance, is a glaring issue. It's a manipulative practice that forces consumers into unnecessary upgrades, feeding into a cycle of waste and expenditure that benefits corporations at the expense of users and the environment.

It’s time to break free from this unsustainable cycle. Extending smartphone release cycles to every five years, for instance, would allow for genuinely significant hardware advancements and mitigate the environmental and economic impacts of frequent upgrades. It would also align more closely with the actual needs and wants of consumers, who are often perfectly satisfied with their devices and do not require annual upgrades.

It's high time we explore and enforce policies that allow open software to run on devices, enabling them to be patched and maintained even when the original company ceases support or intentionally bloats them. This approach could extend the life of devices, providing consumers with more control and reducing the pressure to upgrade.

The smartphone industry is in dire need of a radical overhaul. Manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers must collectively pivot towards models that prioritise sustainability, longevity, and genuine innovation over profit and planned obsolescence. Let’s demand better, for the sake of our pockets, our planet, and our technological future.
