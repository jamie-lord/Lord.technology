Mary is kindly getting me the Sony 55mm f1.8 Zeiss lens for my Î±7 IV. I already own the Sony 90mm f2.8 macro, and I've been wanting the 55mm for a while because of its excellent image quality and small size compared to the Sony 50mm f1.2. It's also much cheaper, which is a bonus.

The lens feels tiny on the body compared to my other lenses.

I'm excited to take it out. Its small size and low weight should be perfect for some night time street photography around Nottingham, something I haven't done in a while.
