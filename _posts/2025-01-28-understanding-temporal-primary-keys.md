Temporal databases have long been a fascinating yet complex topic in database design. With PostgreSQL 18 coming later this year, one of its most anticipated features is native support for temporal primary and foreign keys. But what exactly are they, and why should you care?

## The Temporal Challenge

Traditional primary keys uniquely identify rows in a database table. However, when dealing with time-varying data - like an employee's department assignments over time, or product prices throughout different periods - we need something more sophisticated.

Consider this scenario: Alice works in Sales from January to March, then moves to Marketing until June. With a traditional primary key, we can't properly represent both these assignments for Alice, as they'd violate uniqueness constraints. This is where temporal primary keys come in.

## Enter Temporal Primary Keys

A temporal primary key combines an identifier with a time period, ensuring that no two rows overlap for the same entity during any given time. It's not just about uniqueness at a point in time - it's about uniqueness across time periods.

In PostgreSQL 18's implementation, you'll be able to write something like:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD PRIMARY KEY (
  employee_id,
  PERIOD valid_time WITHOUT OVERLAPS
);
```

This ensures that no employee can have overlapping assignments - precisely what we need for time-aware data.

## Why This Matters

The implications are significant for any application dealing with historical data or future-dated changes. Think insurance policies, contract periods, price changes, or any scenario where "when" is as important as "what".

Previously, developers had to implement these constraints at the application level or through complex triggers. Native database support means better data integrity, simpler code, and improved performance.

## Looking Forward

While this feature will initially support "valid time" (when something is true in the real world), there's potential for extending it to "system time" (when something was recorded in the database) - enabling full bi-temporal data management.

The addition of temporal primary and foreign keys represents a significant step forward in handling time-variant data in relational databases. As businesses increasingly need to track not just current state but also historical changes and future plans, these features couldn't come at a better time.
