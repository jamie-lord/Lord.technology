Earlier today I turned Cloudflare's automatic email obfuscation off on this site. _Why_ you might ask? Well because it was the only JavaScript on this site and I liked the idea of having absolutely none. A JS free website in 2018 is highly unusual, from analytics to graphics frameworks, a lot can be done with the terrible language[^1]. But I have no need for it here, this is a pure website, one that is as fast as your browser and should load instantly on the dodgiest of internet connections and tiniest of devices.

I find this all rather amusing - try finding any website that has no JavaScript, and I'm not talking about a fully featured web app, I mean a simple blog like this one, I think you'll really struggle to find a single one.

[^1]: I can't wait for WebAssembly to start taking off and then I can write client side code in a nicer language!
