I've done the last 3 or 4 Hacktoberfests and really enjoyed the motivation to plough into a project during October.

This year I'm thinking about creating a simple forum software using Razor and Postgres after reading through [this thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28549739) on Hacker News discussing the demise of mailing lists and message boards and that most forum software seems to be stuck in the past and not very attractive to administrators or users.

Clearly a fully-functional forum solution is a big undertaking but at least it's a project that breaks into small parts easily so it should be fast to get something rolling that can then be built on.
