Mary and I cancelled Netflix and Spotify a few weeks ago due to lack of use.

Disney+ was never going to get renewed, again due to lack of use. Weâ€™ve found that on our relatively old Samsung TV, the Disney+ app is almost unusably slow and buggy. Iâ€™d blame the old hardware but all the other apps work alright, Disney+ is just terrible for some reason.

Mary uses Spotify a lot more than me so it may well be worth her setting up a subscription just for herself, but I hardly listen to any music these days and when I do I have a feeling that a lot of it could be found on Soundcloud for free anyway.

Netflix does get some use but weâ€™re suffering from there being too much on there and not enough of it being any good. Perhaps if something weâ€™re particularly interested in gets a new series weâ€™ll subscribe again just for that, but I doubt it.

Thereâ€™s something nice about trimming down a bit. Mary and I are very lucky, we donâ€™t need to make this change for financial reasons but saving some money for something weâ€™re not getting enough value from seems like a no-brainer.

Weâ€™re keeping Amazon Prime due to the free shipping. The video and music services are largely terrible, in fact I find the discoverability of the Prime Video app to be some of the worst. At least weâ€™ll get Clarksonâ€™s Farm next year ðŸšœ.

This change does make me reconsider if I should bite the bullet and treat myself to YouTube Premium due to the amount of time I use it. Itâ€™s Google though so itâ€™s a hard sell for me to throw money at it even if I do like a lot of creators on that platform, perhaps Patreon is another option to support those I really appreciate more directly?
