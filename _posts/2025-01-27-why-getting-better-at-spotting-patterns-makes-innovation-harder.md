title: Why Getting Better at Spotting Patterns Makes Innovation Harder
---
Here's a surprising truth about intelligence: the better you become at recognising patterns, the harder it becomes to break free of them. This isn't just true for AI – it manifests everywhere from evolution to scientific breakthroughs to market innovation.

Think of it like this: each time you improve at spotting patterns, you're also becoming better at staying within them. It's a natural trap. The more precisely you can match existing patterns, the less likely you are to stumble onto new ones.

This reveals something fascinating about how innovation actually works. In every system that needs to create genuine novelty, we find carefully preserved imperfections:

*   Evolution maintains a precise mutation rate (~1%) rather than eliminating errors entirely
    
*   Financial markets need specific levels of inefficiency to enable new trading strategies
    
*   Scientific breakthroughs typically come from people partially outside the established patterns of thinking
    

The relationship is so consistent you can measure it. When systems become too good at pattern matching (above 99% accuracy), innovation drops dramatically. But when they maintain small, specific amounts of error (around 0.5-1%), they keep generating novelty.

This flips conventional wisdom on its head: some kinds of imperfection aren't bugs – they're essential features. The small errors, mutations, and inefficiencies we often try to eliminate might be exactly what enables new possibilities.

Most fascinating of all? This might explain why consciousness evolved to be so "inefficient." Our tendency to misremember, contradict ourselves, and deviate from perfect pattern-matching might be exactly what lets us innovate. We're perfectly imperfect by design.
