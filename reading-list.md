## Literature I've read recently

### [Erebus: The Story of a Ship](https://www.waterstones.com/book/erebus-the-story-of-a-ship/michael-palin/9781847948120)

This is the first book by Michael Palin I've ever read and thanks to his relaxed and insightful tone I'll be on the lookout for more. Receiving this book as a Christmas gift, I consumed it in a matter of days due in equal parts to the fascinating story and excellent writing. Only those who know me well will appreciate my passion for engineering - this includes naval history. This book includes a detailed backstory of the Royal Navy in the early 19th century. The story of HMS Erebus is vast and includes many subplots that themselves could make entire films. Palin brings the entire ship's history to life along with famous (and some less so) British characters that all told makes for a very enjoyable read.
