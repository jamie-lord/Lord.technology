## Literature I've read recently

### [Erebus: The Story of a Ship](https://www.waterstones.com/book/erebus-the-story-of-a-ship/michael-palin/9781847948120)

This is the first book by Michael Palin I've ever read and thanks to his relaxed and insightful tone I'll be on the lookout for more. Receiving this book as a Christmas gift, I consumed it in a matter of days due in equal parts to the fascinating story and excellent writing. Only those who know me well will appreciate my passion for engineering - this includes naval history. This book includes a detailed backstory of the Royal Navy in the early 19th century. The story of HMS Erebus is vast and includes many subplots that themselves could make entire films. Palin brings the entire ship's history to life along with famous (and some less so) British characters that all told makes for a very enjoyable read.

### [The Railway Adventures: Places, Trains, People and Stations](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-railway-adventures/vicki-pipe/geoff-marshall/9781910463871)

Chronicling the best bits of Geoff & Vicki's remarkable adventure to visit (all the stations)[http://allthestations.co.uk/] in Great Britain during 2018. The duo managed to visit all 2563 stations and vlogged their experience on YouTube. The book covers some of the best places, trains, stations and people they saw and met along the way. Their enthusiasm for the railway is infectious and the book highlights some of the best things about our network as well as some of its historical failings. There are many places they visit that I've never considered going to but will now. Including some good photography and local knowledge, this book acts as a travel guide to both well-known cities and rural backwaters.
